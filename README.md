# Tv-Shows-And-Subtitle-Renamer
A Light weight Windows Form To Rename Your Tv-Show Videos and subtitles with The Same Name From IMDB Using Some Scrapping and Regex and system Modules

The app isn't Perfect and The Files Must Have Some Kind of Sequence For it To Work 
but The Good News is it shows You a Preview before it Renames The Files , if it's Correct go ahead and Rename if it's not just use it on another Tv-show

# How To Use it 
 it's very Simple you just Write The name of The Show and it will display all possible Search Resualts from IMDB then Choose The Right one Then The Folder tha contains The Tv-Show with The subtitles And Make Sure You don't have Any Folders inside The Tv-Show's Folder.
